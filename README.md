# JavaScript Coding Quiz

## What
#### This is a coding quiz built from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JS. The timer starts at 76 seconds and 10 seconds are removed for incorrect answers. The final score is equal to the time left at the end of the quiz, so the quicker the better.
--------------
## Why
#### This was a project assignment for Week 4 of my full-stack coding bootcamp. The intent was to get familiar with JavaScript concepts such as event listeners, DOM interaction, local storage, and data attributes among other things.
--------------
## How
#### I started by setting up my basic HTML structure and doing a minimal amount of styling with CSS - my main focus was getting the JavaScript to function properly. I started with my timer function, and gradually built the script out from there to add functionality such as generating questions from a preconstructed JSON object, storing scores and initials locally, sorting the scores to display in descending order by score, and clearing the local storage with a button. The most difficult part by far was storing the high scores. I accomplished this by adding JSON objects to an empty list, with each object for each score entry having keys for "score" and "initials."
